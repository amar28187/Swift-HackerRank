 ## How to Use Markup to Format Playgrounds
 ### Setup
 * To view the formatted text and links, go to Editor -> Show Rendered Markup.
 * To make it easier to switch between Raw-Markup and Rendered-Markup, go to Xcode -> Preferences -> Key Bindings -> filter "Markup" -> Assign Option-R as the key binding.
 * \//: This is how to write a single line of markup.
 * \/\*: This is how to write multiples lines of markup. *\/
